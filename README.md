🧾 Project Title:

Smart Energy Meter with Theft and Temperature Protection System


---

📘 Project Description:

This project is designed to develop a smart energy meter that not only measures power consumption but also detects electricity theft and provides temperature protection for enhanced safety.
It aims to improve efficiency, accuracy, and safety in power usage monitoring.

In this system:

The energy meter calculates real-time power consumption.

Theft detection alerts when illegal power usage is detected.

Temperature sensor monitors overheating and disconnects the supply automatically.

The data can be monitored easily and helps in preventing electrical hazards.
